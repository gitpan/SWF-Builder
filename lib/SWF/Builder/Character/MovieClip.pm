=head1 NAME

SWF::Builder::Character::MovieClip - SWF movie clip object.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $new_mc = $movie->new_movie_clip;
  my $mc_shape = $new_mc->new_shape
    ->moveto( ... )->lineto( ... )...
  $mc_shape->place;

  my $mc_i = $new_mc->place;
  $mc_i->on('EnterFrame')->r_rotate(10);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Movie clips are sub movies which can be included in other movie clips.
They have their own timeline, child instances, and actions.
An SWF::Builder::MovieClip object has character constructors and other methods
for movies. See L<SWF::Builder>.
Each instance of movie clip objects can have clip actions.

=over 4

=item $new_mc = $mc->new_movie_clip

=item $new_mc = $mc->new_mc

returns a new movie clip. 

=item $mc->new_XXX

Character constructors. See L<SWF::Builder>.

=item $as = $mc->init_action

returns SWF::Builder::ActionScript object to initialize the movie clip.

=item $mc_i = $mc->place( ... )

returns the display instance of the movie clip. See L<SWF::Builder>.

=item $mc_i->on( $event [, $key] )

=item $mc_i->onClipEvent( $event [, $key] )

sets a clip action to the movie clip instance and returns
SWF::Builder::ActionScript object for it.
See L<SWF::Builder::ActionScript> for the details of the actionscript.
The method 'on' and 'onClipEvent' is same for movie clip instances.

Supported events are described as follows:
