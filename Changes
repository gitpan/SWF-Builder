Revision history for Perl extension SWF::Builder.

0.10 Sat Jul 30 23:38:00 2005
	- Imported character wrongly deleted if the character be reffered only by ActionScript. Fixed.
	- GD bitmap is now converted by reading GD binary data directly (Experimental).
	  To use the older version (to convert pixel by pixel), $m->new_bitmap($gd, 'GDPixel');
	- Fixed to fail embedding composite glyphs. (Thanks to Herbert Volkmann)

0.09 Sun Jun 12 01:23:45 2005
	- ActionScript compiler now supports 'set' statement.
	- $movie->use_namespace($ns) prepares ActionScript namespace.
	- 'init_action' for the _root movie is supported.
	- Characters and display instances are named automatically by default.
	  $movie->no_namer cancels this feature.
	- $as->gotoAndPlay/gotoAndStop jumped to a wrong frame. Fixed.
	- Debug print for $as->tellTarget was removed. (Thanks to Jon Orwant) 
	- $as->tellTarget got a wrong target path if you gave a display instance.
	  You must give a target path in string now.
	- ActionScript compiler wrongly optimized constant expressions. Fixed.
	   Limitation: It can optimize only the constant terms that queued up
	   from the head sequentially, i.e. 2*2*a is optimized into 4*a,
	   but a*2*2 isn't.
	- Fixed synopsis of SWF::Builder::Character::Bitmap POD.
                                           (Thanks to Merijn van den Kroonenberg)
	- SWF::Builder::Character::Text is rewritten with new SWF::Element::TEXTRECORD.
	   SWF::File (SWF::Element) ver.0.41 is required.
